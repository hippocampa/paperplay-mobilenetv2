# Paperplay: MobileNetV2

Welcome to Paperplay, an ongoing series of me replicating paper.

This project focuses on implementing the **MobileNetV2 architecture**, a renowned convolutional neural network (CNN), from the ground up using the PyTorch framework. My implementation will delve into the core element, the **bottleneck block**, and explore its role within the overall network structure.

**Project highlights:**

* **Bottleneck Block Implementation:** Create a faithful PyTorch rendition of the MobileNetV2 bottleneck block, incorporating depthwise separable convolutions and linear bottlenecks.
* **Network Architecture Construction:** Precisely stack and arrange the bottleneck blocks according to MobileNetV2's architecture.
* **Training and Evaluation:** Train the implemented network on an image classification dataset and assess its performance with standard metrics.
